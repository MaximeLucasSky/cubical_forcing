# cubical_forcing

This compiles using the `coq-8.8` branch of coq, and the up `update-translation-plugin` of metacoq. Note that the latter does not compile completely, but a 
  # make translations
compiles enough for our purpose.

Detailed installation instruction:
If you alredy have a working installation of the right version of Coq and of Metacoq (for example through opam), then simply modify the `_Coqproject` file so that it points to the right location. What follows are the instructions for a full installation from scratch.

  - Create a directory <instal dir> and go in it.
  # mkdir forcing
  # cd forcing
  - Download and build the right version of Coq
  # git clone https://github.com/coq/coq.git
  # cd coq/
  # git checkout -b coq.8.8 origin/v8.8
  # ./configure -local
  # make -j4
  # cd ..
  - Set your command lin to use the right directory:
  # export COQBIN=/path/to/the/directory/forcing/coq/bin/
  - Dowload right version of Metacoq
  # git clone https://github.com/MetaCoq/metacoq.git
  # cd metacoq
  # git checkout -b update-translation origin/update-translation-plugin
  - In order to compile using the version of Coq built earlier we need to modify the files `tempalte-coq/Makefile` and `translations/Makefile`: in both cases, replace the line 
  # coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile.coq
by the following
  # $(COQBIN)/coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile.coq
We can now build metacoq:
  # make translations
This command should fail in some file in `translations`. The important part is that the file `translation_utils` gets built.
  - You can now download and build this repository:
  # cd ..
  # git clone https://github.com/MaximeLucasSky/cubical_forcing.git
  # cd cubical_forcing
  # ../coq/bin/coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
  # make
